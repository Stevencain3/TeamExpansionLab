# Project Description

For this lab, our team worked together to build a Multi-Counter Dashboard in React.
We started with the code from our individual lab and expanded it into a group project.
## The purpose was to practice core React concepts, including:

*Functional components
*Props
*State management (lifting state up)
*Using lists with keys
*Controlled forms
*Derived UI
*Saving data with Local Storage
*Features
*Our app can:
*Add counters with custom names
*Increment, decrement, and reset each counter
*Delete counters
*Show the total sum of all counters
*Display “No counters yet” when the list is empty
*Save counters and values even after refreshing the page

## Final project structure:

src/
-> main.jsx
 ->App.jsx
-> index.css
-> components/
   -> AddCounterForm.jsx
->CounterCard.jsx
    ->CounterList.jsx
    -> Header.jsx
   ## How to Run the Project

Create a new Vite project:
npm create vite@latest multi-counter 
cd latest
npm run dev
## Team Task List

Mason → Made a video walk-through showing all working components

Steven → Created a video explaining the code design and challenges

Rania  → Wrote the documentation and project details in this README
## Reflection

This lab helped us review and apply important React concepts as a team.
We practiced building and reusing components, passing data with props, managing state, and saving data with local storage.

Working as a group also showed us how to divide tasks, collaborate, and combine our work into one final project.
