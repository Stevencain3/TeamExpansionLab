# Lab 5.2 – Team Expansion Lab 1  

## Project Description  
For this lab, our team worked together to build a Multi-Counter Dashboard in React. We took the code from the last individual lab and expanded it as a team project. The goal was to practice using React concepts like functional components, props, lifted state, lists with keys, controlled forms, derived UI, and persistence with local Storage  

## What the App Can Do  
- Add counters with names  
- Increment, decrement, and reset each counter.  
- Delete counters.  
- Show the total sum of all counters.  
- Show a message “No counters yet” if the list is empty.  
- Keep counters and values saved even after refreshing the page.
