#Lab 5.2 – Team Expansion Lab 1
##Project Description
For this lab, our team worked together to build a Multi-Counter Dashboard in React. We took the code from the last individual lab and expanded it as a team project. The goal was to practice using React concepts like functional components, props, lifted state, lists with keys, controlled forms, derived UI, and persistence with local Storage
##What the App Can Do
•	Add counters with names 
•	Increment, decrement, and reset each counter.
•	Delete counters.
•	Show the total sum of all counters.
•	Show a message “No counters yet” if the list is empty.
•	Keep counters and values saved even after refreshing the page.
##	File Setup
##	The project setup followed t Final file tree:
•	src/
•	  main.jsx
•	  App.jsx
•	  index.css
•	  components/
•	    AddCounterForm.jsx
•	    CounterCard.jsx
•	    CounterList.jsx
•	    Header’s
##	The lab instructions:
•	npm create vite@latest multi-counter -- --template react
•	cd multi-counter
•	npm i
•	npm run dev



##Team Task List
•	Mason → Created a walk-through video showing all working components.
• Steven → Created a video that explains the code design and challenges.
•	Rania  → Documented the task list and project details in this README.
##Reflection
•	This lab helped us practice basic React concepts as a team. We got more comfortable with components, props, state, and how to update the UI when data changes. Working in a group also showed us how to split tasks and combine everything together into one final project.
