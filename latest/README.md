# Lab 5.2 – Team Expansion Lab 1

## 📌 Project Description
For this lab, our team worked together to build a **Multi-Counter Dashboard** in React.  
We took the code from the previous individual lab and expanded it into a **team project**.  

The goal was to practice React concepts such as:
- Functional components  
- Props  
- Lifted state  
- Lists with keys  
- Controlled forms  
- Derived UI  
- Persistence with Local Storage  





## 🚀 Features (What the App Can Do)
- ➕ Add counters with custom names  
- 🔼 Increment, 🔽 decrement, and 🔄 reset each counter  
- 🗑️ Delete counters  
- ➕➕ Display the **total sum** of all counters  
- 📝 Show a message **“No counters yet”** when the list is empty  
- 💾 Save counters and values even after refreshing the page  



## 📂 File Setup
The final project structure:

src/
├── main.jsx
├── App.jsx
├── index.css
└── components/
├── AddCounterForm.jsx
├── CounterCard.jsx
├── CounterList.jsx
└── Header.jsx



## ⚙️ How to Run the Project
1. Create a new Vite project:  
 
   npm create vite@latest multi-counter -- --template react
Move into the project folder:


Copy code
cd multi-counter
Install dependencies:


Copy code

👥 Team Task List

🎥 Mason → Created a walk-through video showing all working components.

🎬Steven→ Created a video explaining code design and challenges.

📝 Rania (me) → Documented the task list and project details in this README.
## Reflection

This lab helped us practice fundamental React concepts as a team.
We got more comfortable with:

Building and reusing components

Passing data with props

Managing state and updating the UI when data changes

Saving data with local storage

Working in a group also showed us how to split tasks, collaborate effectively, and merge our work into one final project.
