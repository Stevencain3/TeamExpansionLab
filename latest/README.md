# Lab 5.2 – Team Expansion Lab 1

## 📌 Project Description
For this lab, our team worked together to build a **Multi-Counter Dashboard** in React.  
We took the code from the previous individual lab and expanded it into a **team project**.  

The goal was to practice React concepts such as:
- Functional components  
- Props  
- Lifted state  
- Lists with keys  
- Controlled forms  
- Derived UI  
- Persistence with Local Storage

## 🚀 What the App Can Do
- ➕ Add counters with names  
- 🔼 Increment, 🔽 decrement, and 🔄 reset each counter  
- 🗑️ Delete counters  
- ➕➕ Show the **total sum** of all counters  
- 📝 Display **“No counters yet”** when the list is empty  
- 💾 Persist counters and values even after refreshing the page
